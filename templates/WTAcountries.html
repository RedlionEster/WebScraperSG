    <h1 class="title">Which country rules the WTA?</h1>
    <h2 class = "subtitle">
        We wanted to understand in which countries women's tennis is strong and how this has evolved during the past 10 years.

        The first piece of data that we want to show you, is a little graph that holds the top 20 nations in the WTA if one considers the current top 100 ranks.
        You can see how many players each country currently has representing them in the WTA top 100 players. 
    </div>
    <div class = "container">
        <img src="{{ url_for('return_graph', key='top20_wta100_countries_ranked_by_appearance2024-07-29')}}" alt="top 20 countries represented in WTA 500">

    <div class="box">
        You probably noticed that the top 5 spots are currently taken by:
        <ul>
            {% for spot in top5 %}
            <li>{{ spot }}</li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
        At the time of writing, both the USA and Russia have a big lead over the rest of the world. For avid tennis fans this is hardly surprising.

        Lets look at our second piece of data. Here we asked ourselves the same question, "Which country rules the WTA?" but we broadened the dataset. 
        Now instead of looking only at the elite top 100, we widened it to the best 500 ranked players. 
    </div>
    <div class = "container">
        <img src="{{ url_for('return_graph', key='top20_wta500_countries_ranked_by_appearance2024-07-29')}}" alt="top 20 countries represented in WTA 500">

    <div class = "box">
        Keen eyed readers probaby already spotted some fascinating differences. Let's look at the top 5 again:   
    </div>
    <ul>
        {% for rank in top5_500 %}
        <li>{{ rank }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    <div class = "box">
        As one can see, Japan has made it all the way to top 4, beating China out of the top 5.
